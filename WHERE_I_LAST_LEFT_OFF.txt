I think Group needs to be refactored to named html types like

class ParagraphGroup
class TextGroup

something like that

then render based off what they are an instance of and what their properties are?

I'm not sure that the way things are starting and ending is correct. 
For instance, all the bold, unbold, italic, and text on a newline all 
should be children of fldrslt.

this might be a problem exclusive to fields and fldrslts because otherwise you can start and end a group whenever
might need to do something special just for fields

test current functionality without fields

also, setup the workaround for now
