I think Group needs to be refactored to named html types like

class ParagraphGroup
class TextGroup

something like that

then render based off what they are an instance of and what their properties are?

I'm not sure that the way things are starting and ending is correct. 
For instance, all the bold, unbold, italic, and text on a newline all 
should be children of fldrslt.
